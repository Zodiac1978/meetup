# Meetup
===

Meetup is a mobile-first [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) theme with a focus on meetups and community-related blogging and meetups. 

**Heads up! Switched Google Webfonts implementation from Javascript to CSS in latest version 0.7. Please update your theme options if you’ve set custom webfonts!**

* Responsive, mobile-first design.
* Post formats for comprehensive blogging: Aside, Gallery, Image, Link, Quote, Video.
* Extra Meetup metabox and shortcode to promote your meetup events easily. (No CPT hassle, though, just regular posts— WordPress's default features rock!)
* <del>Better image management with rewritten gallery and caption code.</del> Moved to a [Toolbox module](https://github.com/glueckpress/modules)
* Just enough Theme Options for easy customization.
* Designer-friendly plain CSS (no SASS/LESS). ☺
* GPL-compatible icon font [Entypo by Daniel Bruce](http://www.entypo.com)
* Based upon [_s](https://github.com/automattic/_s) by Automattic.
