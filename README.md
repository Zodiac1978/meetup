* Responsive, mobile-first design.
* Post formats for comprehensive blogging: Aside, Gallery, Image, Link, Quote, Video.
* Extra Meetup metabox and shortcode to promote your meetup events easily. (No CPT hassle, though, just regular posts— WordPress's default features rock!)
* Better image management with rewritten gallery and caption code.
* Just enough Theme Options for easy customization.
* Designer-friendly plain CSS (no SASS/LESS). ☺
* GPL-compatible icon font [Entypo by Daniel Bruce](http://www.entypo.com)
* Based upon [_s](https://github.com/automattic/_s) by Automattic.
